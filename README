This is an example project demonstrating how to draw a polyline inside an
MKMapView that continues to display correctly even as a user pinches and zooms
the map. It incorporates and expands upon ideas from Craig Spitzkoff and
Nicolas Neubauer.

This solution is focused on iPhone OS versions pro to 4.x
Note: In iPhone OS 4.0 the MKPolyline has been added.

However, if you want to create an application, which should run on iOS versions prior to 4.x and make use of a polyline, you should use this project's polyline implementation.

The original example from http://github.com/wlach contained some bugs, which did not seem to get fixed. Bugs fixed:
- Polyline View overlaps other Annotation Views (http://github.com/wlach/nvpolyline/issues#issue/2)
- App crashes when zoomed in (http://github.com/wlach/nvpolyline/issues#issue/1)
